WIP

##### Steps to be done

- Create Terraform configuration

- Separate Jenkins, Sonarqube configuration steps into separate files.

- Ensure Jenkins build is not triggered by changes in certain items like Terraform folder, Instruction text files, etc

- Make the output a webpage describing the project.

- Create script that automates this whole process.

- Make this a declarative Jenkins pipeline (i.e in Groovy)
